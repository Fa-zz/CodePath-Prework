## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Apps and features that I like:
* Discord: direct messaging, group chats, notifications, looking up users to friend
* Twitter/X: Night/day mode, ability to make profile "private" or "public", friend requests
* Pentix Nova (Tetris): Sound/music, customization options, tutorial for playing game

App idea: Creating a frontend for the API game "[SpaceTraders API](https://spacetraders.io/)", a multiplayer game played entirely by accessing HTTP endpoints. I want to build a GUI using Swift/UIKit that makes the API calls and fetches the resulting information in order to play the game. I'll include the features from above, including messaging, friend system, sound/music, and settings including night/day mode. Using Python, I'll write my own backend that'll allow users to search, "friend", and DM other users who use my app to play the game (I do not believe these are features available with the API itself). 

## Notes

Issues I ran into
* Minor issue following the directions on connecting the UI to the logic.
* Instructions on creating a gif were not clear
